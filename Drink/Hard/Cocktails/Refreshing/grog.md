**Abstract:** The original purpose of grog was for sailers to be both peaceable and staying hydrated with something disinfected. This is obviously not a worthwhile reason to drink it now. Presently I encourage this drink for two reasons:

1. It brings out the flavor of the rum, in much the same way as a dab of water does for whiskey. (Decent rum is required for this reason)
2. It's a pleasantly refreshing drink on a hot day as it is mostly water.
