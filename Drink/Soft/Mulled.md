## Tools: ##

- Large boiling pot (or else half the recipe if your only pots are too small).
- Cheese cloth
- Strainer
- Something to hold almost a gallon of finished cider.

Optional but handy: Large bowl to strain the results into.

## Ingredients: ##

- 1 Gallon of Apple Cider of your choosing (or red wine, though if you want a mulled red wine, I suggest using apple cider or water to make a concentrate for adding to your wine)
- 2 Whole Navel Oranges
- 1 Lemon
- 2-4" Fresh ginger (choose based on how much you like ginger)
- Ground nutmeg

Any of: AllSpice, Cloves whole or ground, Cinnamon Sticks, Pumpkin Pie Spice, Ground Cinnamon, or other fall flavors you personally enjoy.

## Steps: ##

0. Get out your large boiling pot, your cutting board, and grab all the fresh ingredients together.
1. Quarter the oranges and toss 'em in the pot.
2. Half the lemon and toss it in the pot.
3. Skin and thinly slice the ginger (1-2mm, nothing too thin is necessary), toss the slices in the pot.
  - don't worry about skinning too deeply, the portion just under the skin is typically dry and fibrous and something you want to remove, so just skin with broad strokes.
4. Add 2 tbsp Ground nutmeg to the pot.
5. Add 2-6 tbsp of other spices to the pot from the list above as you please, depending on how much you like the spicing flavor vs. citrus.
6. Pour gallon of apple cider in the pot.
7. Bring to a low boil.
8. Stir often to keep the spices circulating and releasing their oils (and not burning to the bottom of your pot).
9. When the flesh of the citrus fruits has become completely soft and mushy giving no resistance to squishing with a spoon, it's done (typically 30-60 minutes).
  - **Option:** You may leave this to boil longer to reduce to a concentrate, I encourage this if you wish to mix with wine to make a Mulled Wine as the Wine will dillute it. Mixing the concentrate with a tea like Sleepy Time is also quit delicious.
  - **Word of caution:** Monitor the reduction (especially if you opt for halfing the recipe which is perfectly fine), if you just leave this to sit and don't monitor it, you'll find a pile of apple cider sugars burned on the bottom of your pot.
10. Turn off the burner.
11. If you have a large bowl to strain the results into grab that now, if it's not metal, wait for the cider to cool so as not to melt it.
12. Line your strainer with 2 layers of cheese cloth - folding one layer may work but if it's overly large you may wish to make a + pattern with 2 pieces.
13. Put the strainer over your bowl for the results and *slowly* pour your cider in.
  - **Word of caution:** The cloths filtering will become clogged and you will almost certainly need to stop filling it and replace with a fresh cheese cloth to keep filtering.
14. When you are done, lift the sides of the cloth with all the goodies inside, wrap the wart and squeeze out any extra juice, careful not to squeeze the spices through (ground particulates are blech).

Enjoy hot or cold, dillute with more apple cider if you find the flavor a bit strong, or an herbal tea such as sleepy time, chamomile, spearmint.

Optional mixins:
 - Brandy
 - Bitters
 - Wine (red! white would meld poorly)
 - Whiskey (the reduction of the Cider may be quite sweet depending on the cider used, the sweetness can go well with many whiskeys just as honey goes well with them)
 - Tea (I would encourage herbal, but a black tea may work well too, I would avoid mixing green)
